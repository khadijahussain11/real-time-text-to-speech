# 🗣️ Text-to-Speech Converter | HTML, CSS & JavaScript

This is a **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Converter Web App** built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**. It allows users to input any text and instantly hear it spoken out loud using the browser’s built-in **Web Speech API** (Speech Synthesis). The project is lightweight, responsive, and works seamlessly on all modern browsers — making it an excellent beginner-friendly JavaScript project that demonstrates DOM manipulation, user interaction, and real-time audio generation.

## 📚 How It Works

This web app uses the **Web Speech API**, specifically the `SpeechSynthesis` interface, to convert text into spoken audio.

1. The user types or pastes any text into the input box.
2. On clicking the "Convert to Speech" button, the JavaScript code uses `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` to create a voice output.
3. The selected voice and language (if applicable) is used to speak the text aloud in real-time.

The beauty of this project is its simplicity — no backend, no API keys, and no frameworks — just pure front-end logic.
